This is a DevMode.java implementation able to run superdevmode.

It's compatible with GWT 2.5.x and 2.6.x

You have to put this in your classpath before gwt-dev.jar, also
you need gwt-codeserver.jar, then you can run the launcher with
the parameter -superDevMode to start a jetty server and a code
server with everything set.
